# Floating-point-and-Integer-converters

1. Write a program in any language that converts a floating-point number to its simplified floating-point representation or the IEEE 754 format discussed in the slides.  

The simplified model uses 1 bit for the sign, 5 bits for the exponent, and 8 bits for the significand.  
Include a header and add comments throughout your code.  
Compile and run your program, demonstrating its output with at least two examples (one positive and one negative number).  
2. Write a short program in any language that converts a signed integer between signed magnitude and 2's complement. The input could be signed magnitude or 2's complement.  

Ensure your code performs basic error checking and handles both positive and negative numbers.  
Compile and run your program, and show its output with at least two examples (one positive and one negative number).
